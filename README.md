# Assignment: Build a online Library

### Objective:
Take the javascript constructor lesson into pratice and build an online library app

### Task:
Build a basic recipe website with the following specifications:

- All of your book objects are going to be stored in a simple array, so add a function to the script (not the constructor) that can take user‚Äôs input and store the new book objects into an array.
- Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page.
- Add a ‚ÄúNEW BOOK‚Äù button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it‚Äôs been read and anything else you might want.
- Add a button on each book‚Äôs display to remove the book from the library.
- Add a button on each book‚Äôs display to change its read status.
